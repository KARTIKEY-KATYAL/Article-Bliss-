# Project Name SummariserGPT

## Overview

SummariserGPT is a web-based platform that enables users to discover and summarize articles from various topics. The application provides a user-friendly interface to browse articles and generate concise summaries, all powered by content fetched via RapidAPI. Instead of relying on a traditional backend, SummariserGPT integrates external APIs for real-time data fetching, ensuring the platform remains fast and dynamic.

Built with React on the front-end, SummariserGPT utilizes Redux Toolkit for efficient state management across the application. With Redux Toolkit, the platform handles article data, summaries, and user interactions seamlessly, offering an optimized, scalable solution.

By leveraging RapidAPI, SummariserGPT pulls articles from multiple sources and uses advanced summarization tools to condense lengthy articles into digestible summaries, making it a powerful tool for users looking to quickly consume information.

Key features of SummariserGPT include:

Real-time fetching and displaying of articles from multiple sources via RapidAPI
Summarization of articles into shorter, more readable formats
Global state management using Redux Toolkit for efficient handling of article data and UI state
A clean, intuitive user interface for seamless interaction and browsing
This project showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs, manage application state effectively with Redux Toolkit, and deliver a fully functional front-end that provides users with an optimized and engaging experience.
